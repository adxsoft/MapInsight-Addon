Freeplane Add-on for exploring maps and connecting idea

MapInsight addon provides a simple UI for walking around a map and optionally creating connectors 

Using a lot of connectors, a map can get very confusing. This simple UI gives the view from a selected node showings its parent, children, connectors in and out. Hovering over a node in the UI reveals the notes and details.

Connection Candidates tool finds possible connections through link words, phrases or regular expressions and allows you to create the connector

Connection Manager shows all connectors in the map in a sortable table with edit/delete options
